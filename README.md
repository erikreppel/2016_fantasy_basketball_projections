2016 Fantasy Basketball Projections
-------

**Purpose**: Every year me and 9 of my friends do a fantasy basketball league. We do a league based on fantasy points, meaning every time one of your players a point, assist, rebound, offensive rebound, 3 pointer, turnover, free throw made, free throw missed, or field goal made/missed you get a number of points associated with statistic.

Every year ESPN does projections on how it thinks each player will perform (how many points/assists/rebounds per game they think each player will have). These projections are some times alright, sometimes way off, but either way the form they are presented in isn't any good for drafting players for our scoring system.

This is just a little ipython notebook that loads the projection data from a spreadsheet and calculates how many fantasy points per game each player would average, and ranks players. (It would be nicer to scrape the ESPN website for their projections, but they have purposely made this hard to do)
